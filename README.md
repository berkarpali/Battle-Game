# Battle-Game
Mini turn-based battle game built with Python and OOP principles. 

Description:
  A simple turn-based battle game built with Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates class structures, object interaction, modular design, and basic game mechanics such as random damage and critical hits.

Features:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Character class with attributes and methods
  - Random damage system
  - Critical hit mechanic (%20 chance)
  - Health control (cannot drop below 0)
  - Menu-based combat system
  - Modular file structure

Project Structure:

  battle-game/
  │
  ├── character.py   # Character class
  ├── main.py        # Game loop and menu system
  └── README.md

How to run:

  1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/berkarpali/python-battle-game.git
  
  2. Navigate into the folder:
     cd python-battle-game
  
  3. Run the game:
     python main.py

Technologies used:

  -Python 3
  -Object-oriented-programming (OOP)

Purpose of the Project:

  This project was built to learn and practice:
  - OOP concepts
  - Class and object interaction
  - Modular programming
  - Basic game logic design

Future improvements:

-Add more character types
-Add experince and leveling system
-Add graphical interface
